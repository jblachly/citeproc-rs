# The issue variable is not mentioned in the spec as needing its hyphens replaced.
# The underlying problem is that cs:number is dramatically underused, mostly
# because you have to remember whether or not each variable is a number
# variable in order to use it. Not clear what direction to go on that yet either,
# but for now, this hyphen can stay a hyphen.

# ˀ and ˁ do not have a decomposition in Unicode 12.1.
# ۥ and ۦ don't either, but they also manage not to appear in the web results viewer
#         probably because of a font issue (they're Arabic).
# The rest are correct and haven't changed since the list linked to in the test
# was prepublished. There are others which should also be included but there's
# not much point writing a test for code autogenerated from the actual unicode
# data sheet.

# The french locale itself does not use half-width nbsps, so not sure why the
# bruteforce find-and-replace method should.
# In any case citeproc-rs actually parses French guillemets and renders using
# the French locale file or converts them to whatever other locale.
# So this snapshot has full-width nbsp (\u{a0}/&#8203;/&#x160;) instead.

# The spec says "The 'locator' variable is always rendered with an en-dash replacing any hyphens."
