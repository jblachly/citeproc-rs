//! This is where we do the legacy conversion to EDTF.
//!
//! The `edtf::level_1::Edtf` is our internal representation, and it uses the ISO calendar, i.e.
//! proleptic gregorian but with a zero year, so 0000 = 1BC., -0001 = 2BC.
//!
//! However, old CSL-JSON raw and date-parts dates sit on some unspecified calendar. I believe the
//! logic goes that [[-0001, 1, 9]] is "Jan 9, 1BC", but nothing else about the date is
//! really known. That presents a dilemma, of which neither choice is good at all:
//! - If you read that example directly into fields on an EDTF date, and print it as a historical
//! date, it would be "Jan 9, 2BC".
//! - If you print the EDTF fields verbatim and just slap a BC on the end if negative, then actual
//! EDTFs would be incorrect.
//!
//! Therefore one or the other must be converted. We do not know what calendar dates are on, but we
//! can allow people to configure it if the default is not correct. So we could:
//!
//! - make the default proleptic gregorian, interpret unspecified CSL-JSON dates as being proleptic
//! gregorian using negative years.
//! - make the default 'chronology::historical::Canon', i.e. everything after the Gregorian
//! calendar's introduction is Gregorian, everything before that is Julian.
//!
//! The latter seems slightly better, but I have no evidence to go on.
//!
//! What's most important is that when you read in old CSL-JSON with very old dates, they are not
//! off-by-one-BC-year. Both options accomplish this.
//!
//! A lesser problem is being off-by-ten-days due to divergence between whatever calendar people
//! thought CSL-JSON ran on and the chosen behaviour. This is a fairly isolated problem because
//! most academic cited works are not more than a few hundred years old.
//!
//! There are two reasons why you MUST pick a calendar timeline for legacy CSL-JSON dates.
//!
//! - The values eventually need to be sortable. If you mix ISO and "as written" dates, you will
//! get incorrect sorting.
//! - You can either convert ISO to a chosen historical system at sort/display time, or convert
//! CSL-JSON dates to ISO at input time. Both are equivalent but ISO-from-the-start is easier to
//! manage.
//!
//! Tangentially, there are quite a few options controlling the display behaviour of ISO dates,
//! i.e. what calendar it gets rendered in:
//!
//! - Add InitOptions settings to citeproc-rs for a display calendar system, including a historical
//! 'Canon' one.
//! - Add (to CSL, with a new date part formatter) an indication for an old system date "(o.s.)" or
//! whatever people like to write.
//! - Support TC39 Temporal's postfix `2020-04-25[u-ca=hebrew]` notation for specifying a display
//! calendar system system on an individual date. Details:
//! https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/iso-string-ext.html
//!
